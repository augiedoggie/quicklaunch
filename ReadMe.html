<p><br /></p>
<p>QuickLaunch is a small launcher tool that helps you to quickly start any installed application.</p>
<p>Simply start to enter the name of an application and QuickLaunch will find all programs matching these initial letters and show them in a list. You choose an app from that list with the <span class="key">CursorUp/Down</span> keys and launch it by hitting <span class="key">RETURN</span>. <span class="key">ESC</span> quits QuickLaunch.</p>

<p>Here's the main window after searching for all applications starting with "me" and behind it the settings window when clicking the <span class="button">Setup</span> button (or pressing <span class="key">ALT</span>+<span class="key">S</span>:</p>
<div align = "center">
<img src="./images/quicklaunch.png" alt="QuickLaunch windows" />
</div>
<p>In the main window the context menu was invoked via a right-click.<br />
The first item adds the selected app to your favorites which will be shown whenever the search field is empty.<br />
The second item adds the app to the ignore list (works also with a drag &amp; drop into the ignore list of the setup window). More on that in the setup options discussed below.<br />
The final item opens the app's location in a Tracker window. The same can be achieved by pressing <span class="key">CTRL</span>+<span class="key">RETURN</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="button">Help</span> button or pressing <span class="key">ALT</span>+<span class="key">H</span> opens this ReadMe in the browser.</p>

<h2>
<a href="#"><img src="images/up.png" style="border:none;float:right" alt="index" /></a>
<a id="favorites" name="setup">Favorites</a></h2>

<p>Your list of favorite applications is shown whenever the search field is empty, e.g. right when you start QuickLaunch.</p>
<div align = "center">
<img src="./images/quicklaunch_favorites.png" alt="QuickLaunch favorites" />
</div>
<p>The background of favorites is slightly tinted yellow and a little yellow star is added to their icon to distinguish them from a regular search result.</p>
<p>You add favorites by right-clicking an app's entry in a search result list and choosing <span class="menu">Add to favorites</span> or pressing <span class="key">ALT</span>+<span class="key">F</span>.<br />
Similarly, you remove a favorite again by right-clicking it and selecting <span class="menu">Remove favorite</span> or with <span class="key">ALT</span>+<span class="key">R</span>.</p>
<p><img src="./images/quicklaunch_replicant.png" alt="QuickLaunch replicant favorites" align="left" valign="middle" vspace="5" hspace="32"/>The Deskbar replicant can be activated from the Setup window (see below). It installs the QuickLaunch icon into the Deskbar tray, alongside the clock and the replicants of other applications.<br />
A right-click on it also offers quick access to your favorites.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2>
<a href="#"><img src="images/up.png" style="border:none;float:right" alt="index" /></a>
<a id="setup" name="setup">Setup</a></h2>

<p>The setup window, invoked with the <span class="button">Setup</span> button or <span class="key">ALT</span>+<span class="key">S</span>:</p>
<div align = "center">
<img src="./images/quicklaunch_setup.png" alt="QuickLaunch setup" />
</div>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="menu">Show Deskbar replicant</span> — puts the QuickLaunch icon into the Deskbar tray. A left-click on it starts QuickLaunch, with a right-click you can start your favorite applications directly from the context menu.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="menu">Show the version of an application</span> — only really useful when having older and newer versions of an app installed.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="menu">Show the path to an application</span> —  interesting when you have several copies of an application.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="menu">Search from start of application name</span> —  when unchecked, finds all applications with the search term anywhere in their name, not only with those initial letters. Same as starting a search with a '*' as first letter.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="menu">Wait for a second letter before starting the search</span> — probably only useful for slow systems.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="menu">Remember last search term</span> — starts QuickLaunch with the previous search.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="menu">Launch applications with a single click</span> —  instead of requiring the usual double-click.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="menu">Window always on top</span> — the window floats modally in front of all others. Useful if you start a few apps after another and don't want to lose QuickLauch under the newly opening windows.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="menu">Ignore these files &amp; folders (and their subfolders)</span> that you can add and remove from the list with the buttons at the bottom.<br />
You can also right-click an app in the main window's result list to add that specific app to the ignore list or drag &amp; drop any application or folder from Tracker or an app from QuickLaunch's main window into it.<br />
<span class="key">DEL</span> removes the selected items from the ignore list.</p>
<p>If you add a folder instead of a file, QuickLaunch will ignore all the files and subfolders it contains. Those items are marked with a "<tt>*</tt>" in the list and are printed in italics.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a href="#"><img src="images/up.png" style="border:none;float:right" alt="index" /></a>
<a id="tips" name="tips">Tips &amp; Tricks</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Assign a keycombo to QuickLaunch in Haiku's Shortcuts preferences, like <span class="key">OPT</span>+<span class="key">SPACEBAR</span>, for even quicker QuickLaunching apps.</p></li>
<li><p>Use '*' as wildcards, e.g. "*play" for all apps with "play" in their name. </p></li>
<li><p><span class="key">SHIFT</span>+<span class="key">RETURN</span> will keep the QuickLaunch window open after launching the app.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="key">CTRL</span>+<span class="key">RETURN</span> will open an app's location in Tracker instead of launching it.</p></li>
<li><p>These folders are ignored by default:<br />
<span style="font-family: monospace">B_SYSTEM_ADDONS_DIRECTORY and B_TRASH_DIRECTORY</span><br />
In other words, applications in Trash are ignored, as well as add-ons.<br />
B_SYSTEM_BIN_DIRECTORY used to be ignored, but since especially ported software often ends up in the /bin folder, that is a bad idea. You'll have to remove unwanted commandline apps manually now, i.e. via <span class="menu">Add to ignore list</span> of the context menu.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two reasons why an application may not be found by QuickLaunch:</p>
<p>- The application isn't located on a BFS partition or the BFS partition wasn't formatted to support queries.<br />
- The application lacks the proper attribute <span style="font-family: monospace">BEOS:APP_SIG</span>. In that case, ask the app's developer to add it, or try to apply the following tip.</p></li>
<li><p>If you happen to use an app or a script that doesn't show up in QuickLaunch (and is in a writable location), you can add these atrributes in Terminal to the app or script:<br />
<span style="font-family: monospace">addattr BEOS:TYPE application/x-vnd.Be-elfexecutable /path/to/your/app-or-script<br />
addattr BEOS:APP_SIG  application/x-vnd.anything-unique /path/to/your/app-or-script</span>
</p></li>
</ul>

<a id="thanks" name="thanks">Thanks</a></h2>
<p>	I have to thank DarkWyrm for some helpful hints and for some of the	code I re-used from his RunProgram app and his EscapeCancelFilter.<br />
Equally useful was Robert Polic's EZLauncher of BeNewsletter 3-46 and the help I got on the #haiku IRC channel.<br />
AnEvilYak provided valuable hints and code when I got stuck.<br />
Finally, thanks to everyone that contributed translations and bug reports for QuickLaunch.</p>
