QuickLaunch is a small launcher tool that helps you to quickly start any installed application.

Simply start to enter the name of an application and QuickLaunch will find all programs matching these initial letters and show them in a list. You choose an app from that list with the _CursorUp/Down_ keys and launch it by hitting _RETURN_. _ESC_ quits QuickLaunch.
